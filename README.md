GrayTabby is a tab archiver for Chrome and Firefox.

# Why GrayTabby
* GrayTabby is _simple_. It focuses around one core flow: archival. Most users will get all the value they need out of this tab archiver by clicking one button.
* GrayTabby is _open source_. You can read for yourself that it doesn't share your data.
* GrayTabby is _focused_. It only asks for permission to view and modify your tabs, because that is its purpose in life.
